# 🏥 Smart Care Assistant

A smart, lightweight health management system designed for small clinics and junior doctors to streamline patient rounds, record structured data, and support chronic patients in logging symptoms and medications — with built-in early Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) detection.

## 📖 Problem Statement

**Scenario:**  
Dr. Neha, a junior doctor in a busy community clinic, manages 20–30 chronic patients daily with minimal support staff. Relying on handwritten notes for symptoms, vitals, and prescriptions, she struggles to recall key information by the end of the day. Important side effects or warnings often go unnoticed. A smarter digital solution is needed to help track patient data, detect early warning signs, and improve organization.
